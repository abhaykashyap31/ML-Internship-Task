# Machine Learning Internship Task

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs data analysis and machine learning on a dataset from Kaggle.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost opendatasets
```

## Running the Code

Follow these steps to execute the notebook:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the `.ipynb` file).
2. **Install the required dependencies** using the command above.
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Importing Libraries**: Loads essential Python libraries.
2. **Downloading Dataset**: Uses `opendatasets` to download a dataset from Kaggle.
3. **Preprocessing Data**: Cleans and prepares the dataset.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates insights and visualizations.
5. **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and XGBoost.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. Ensure you have a Kaggle account and API key set up before running the notebook.

To manually download the dataset, place it in the `data/` directory.

## Output

- Processed data
- Visualizations (saved as PNG files)
- Model performance metrics
